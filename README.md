# ROAD_TO_SUCCESS

# Welcome to our project for the SheBuilds2.0 Hackathon from Girls Who Code at Berkeley! 
# We decided to follow the Women in STEM Education Track and build a website that serves as a roadmap/guide of the college years and what experiences students will encounter.

# Main tool to Design and Make Ideas:
 CANVA: https://www.canva.com/design/DAE8xhfJRXU/Wi7FWiNDJ23wNzdhUeq9ig/view?utm_content=DAE8xhfJRXU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
 
 
Inspiration:
We were inspired by our own experiences going into college. We came in feeling overwhelmed and lost, unsure what major and coursework were best suited for us. We also had searched for the best academic and extracurricular resources. We feel that with this project, we are able to compile all of our experiences and resources into one place for other female-identifying students interested in Data Science, Math, & Computer Science.

What it does: 
Our website is a compilation of information and resources for particular academic years in college. We organized our information by what experiences each college year encounters. For example, freshmen and sophomores will be exploring majors, research, clubs whereas junior and seniors will be looking for internships, full-time jobs, and finishing up their major coursework. We added a survey for sophomore students to find elective courses that align with their academic interests.

How we built it: 
We first designed our website layout, color scheme, and content in Canva before we started coding our website. We implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build our website, we started with a foundation of Python, and utilized the IDE Replit. We also referred to W3Schools as a core resources for HTML and CSS as well as Ionic.io for open source icons used in our website.

Challenges we ran into:
We started out using Python and Flask which was initially overwhelming, but we found HTML and CSS to be simpler and moved our focus to those aspects. We both came into this project with no background in HTML, CSS, and web design in general.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We're really proud of our finished product, considering this is our first time building a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. We are also proud of the content we included and we feel it would be helpful to any female-identifying student who is looking for advice or guidance coming into college.

What we learned:
We learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as Python and Flask. Our core learning experience was the web development as a whole. We also learned more about the resources and experiences of different college academic years.

What's next for Road to Success:
We would like to work more on the survey for finding the best elective courses for a student's interests, improve the User Interface and aesthetic, add student interviews for people with different majors, and add another page about how to deal with stress and academics when on your period.
