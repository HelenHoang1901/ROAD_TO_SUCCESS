    <div><h1 style="text-align:center;">Junior Year</h1>
    <p><h2 class="center"> Overview</h2>During your junior year, you will start to reach the upper division level of course work. This will include foundational courses within your major that go beyond the lower level classes you took to declare your major. You will also take electives that will deepen your understanding of higher level concepts.
    </p>
    <p> The rigor of your classes may change drastically depending on your school, major, and course load. Additionally, this is typically the year in which students start looking for summer internships that will help them with full-time job recruitment during their senior year.
    </p>
    <p><h2 class="center"> Tips for Academic Success:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Find and utilize any tutoring available at the upper division level! Course concepts are no longer at level in which you can do some googling to figure it out. </li>
            <li>Go to your professor and TA's office hours. Seriously. They want you to ask questions and have set aside time for you to come and get help! This is especially crucial now, since there can be a learning curve for upper division coursework.</li>

          <li>
            Talk to your classmates and create study buddies/groups; professors will allow you to either collaborate or brainstorm with others on homework and projects. Having a study buddy/group in your classes will probably save you hours of studying on your own and not getting something.

      <h2 class="center"> Some Internship Recruiting Advice:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Start your recruitment process early! Some companies will have their summer recruiting cycle during the fall semester before! For example: For Summer 2022 internships, the company's recruiting cycle may be from September 2021 to December 2021. Other companies will continue to recruit beyond fall and winter, and through the spring semester.

      </li>
      <li>
        For software engineering and data science internships, projects outside of your coursework are great for your resume! Particpating in hackathons (like SheBuilds2.0) is also great experience for your resume! 
      </li>
      <li>
        Some clubs will also have team based projects in partnership with local tech companies. The team will work on a product/project. These clubs will recruit during the first few weeks of the semester through an application and interview process (so yes, they're selective).
