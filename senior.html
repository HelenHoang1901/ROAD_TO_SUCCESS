      </li>
      <li>
        If possible, try and fit any classes you really wanted to take but haven't yet.

    <p> <h2 class="center"> Your Career & Future:</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          As a senior, chances are you're recruiting for full time roles if you don't already have one slated for after graduation. And if you aren't recruiting for full-time, you may be prepping for graduate studies in a masters, PhD, law, or medical school. These are just the two most common pathways. If you aren't doing either, your journey is just as valid and everyone's path is different!
        </li>
        <li>
          For those of you recruiting full-time, you've likely built your résumé up over the last 3 years in college and will be a solid applicant to the roles within your industry. If you're applying for post-grad programs, you are most likely finishing up standardized testing or your application itself, getting letters of recommendation, and planning out your application process in general.
